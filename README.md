An app for Isha yogis to keep track of their sadhana and stay motivated to practice.

## Desired Functionalities:

* Login to user profile

* Selection & addition of various sadhanas

* Adding customized sadhanas (for practices not listed in the app)

* Tracking of which sadhana is done each day

* Tracking how much time each sadhana session lasts (optional)

* Reminders to do sadhana at various times throughout the day (optional)

* Reports: sadhanas done over time (by day, week, month, year)


## Example User Flow

1. User downloads/accesses app

2. Prompt user to select which practices they regularly do from an icon grid of Isha practices

3. Home screen: large, inviting button w/ Namaskar or Ardhasiddhasana icon with tooltip CTA to begin sadhana

4. On press, screen goes dim (on Android, airplane mode is switched on; on iOS, user is prompted to turn it on - this setting can be disabled in settings)

5. Dimmed screen has CTA to start sadhana

6. Upon completion of sadhana, user clicks "Finished" button and is presented with the practices they previously chose

7. User chooses which practices they just completed

8. Home screen; auto scroll below sadhana button and present daily/weekly/monthly/etc. graphical report of practices

9. If user chooses a particular practice report, they can see a more detailed version of the report specifically for that practice; show how much time they do each practice and/or sadhana session

10. Optional: prompt user after a few days to set a reminder to do the practices previously done at the same time(s) they did them before
